    <h3>Cappucino Assassino<h3>
    <p>Cappuccino Assassino fights like his namesake—smooth, controlled, and deceptively strong.<br>
      A technician in the truest sense, he reads opponents like a seasoned tactician, striking only when the timing is perfect and the risk is low.<br>
      Known for hisrazor-sharp counters and pinpoint accuracy,<br>
      Cappuccino excels at breaking down aggressive fighters who overextend. Every movement is intentional—measured footwork,<br> 
      tight defense, and surgical strikes designed to dismantle rather than overwhelm.<br>
      He doesnt brawl. He eliminates.
