    <h3>Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Tung Sahur</h3>
    <p>Tung Tung Tung Sahur is a towering humanoid figure built entirely from dense, reinforced wood.<br>
      Designed for impact and intimidation, his body is rigid and heavy, giving him incredible durability <br>
      in the ring. Each movement is deliberate, with joints that creak under the weight of raw power. <br>
