    <h3>Bombardiro Crocodilo</h3>
    <p>Bombardiro Crocodilo enters the IBFC with a style as unique as his appearance. With a background in precision<br>
      striking and long-range pressure tactics, Bombardiro excels at controlling distance and dictating the pace of a match from the outside.<br>
      Built like a tank with reach to match, he uses wide-arcing strikes, explosive lunges, and unorthodox movement to keep opponents off balance.<br>
      Where others close in—he stays just out of reach, landing heavy shots and retreating before a response can come.He’s a fighter that blends<br>
      strategy with spectacle—calculated chaos, delivered from above. <br>
